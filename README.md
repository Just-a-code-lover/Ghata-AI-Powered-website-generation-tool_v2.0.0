# Ghata-AI-Powered-website-generation-tool_v2.1.0 (Unstable)
My final year project and version 2 of https://github.com/Just-a-code-lover/Ghata-AI-Powered-website-generation-tool_v1.0.0

This project is an AI-powered static website generator built with Streamlit. Users describe their website in natural language, and the system uses NVIDIA's DeepSeek-R1 (or any LLM via API) to generate clean, production-ready HTML, CSS, and JS. The app tracks version history, allowing users to iterate on previous outputs, download individual or all versions as ZIPs, and preview the site live in-browser. It's fully modular — separating UI components, file handling, LLM logic, and session state — making it easy to extend with LangChain, deploy via Azure, or integrate advanced feedback loops in future.
